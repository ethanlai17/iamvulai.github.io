# Hi, I'm Vu Lai

## About me

1. Facts: Gen Z. Aries. Speak Vietnamese (Mother tongue), English (Second language), and Chinese (Conversational language)
2. I used to work in sale (B2B & B&C) for 2 years and change my career path to product management (will be 2 years till the end of 2021). I will pursue Master degree in Information Systems at The University of Sheffield in September 2021.
3. Work is my favorite topic including sharing work experience (especially moving from non-tech to tech), dealing with salary and benefits, learning from start-up, correcting sitting positions during work, etc.
4. Besides work, I’m also keen on FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) with some sub-topics related to different types of investment, passive income streams, and many more. But honestly, I’m an amateur and want to learn from you.
5. I’m a fan of podcasts and Youtube and plan to do in the future (podcast first, Youtube later). Looking for co-hosts and partners 
6. I’m not a fan of subscription (I don’t subscribe Netfilx, Spotfiy or any service with subscription), although I have been working for 2 SaaS platforms, even managing the subscription process 
7. Besides a product management role, I also want to become a part-time lecturer at universities.

## About this blog

1. The main objectives of this are to document and share the progress of connecting the dots in my career path, from non-tech to tech
2. Other objectives are:
    - to develop a “creating interest”, an interest of creating meaningful things, rather than pursue other “absorbing interests”
    - to document new knowledge and skills I learnt in product management.
    - to improve English writing skill
3. At first, the content is mostly about lessons and experiences at my workplace. Later on, there will be other sub-topics in point 3 and interviews with experts and professionals working in other industries such as marketing, data science, human resource, etc.
