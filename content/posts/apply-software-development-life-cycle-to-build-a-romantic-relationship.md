Hello!
Some share that it‚Äôs a bit hard to remember all steps of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), so in this blog, I want to share one practical use case of SDLC in real life, romantic relationship, to memorize it easier.

## SDLC in brief

Before jumping to interesting parts, let‚Äôs revise SDLC quickly with some of my add-ons (Freely skip this section if you get bored with theories)

| No. | Step | Description | 
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| 0 | Stakeholder analysis | This is not usually defined in SDLC, but for me, it‚Äôs essential to note down all involved stakeholders, their influences, and interest. They are our judges anw |
| 1 | Requirement elicitation & analysis | Besides detailed requirements, problem statement/ business need, goal(s), project scope, and success metric(s) should be covered. | 
| 2 | Research/ Feasibility study | For complex projects/systems with many uncertainties, conducting market research or preparing a Proof of Concept before the design phase saves my life. | 
| 3 | Design | Based on requirements and discovery, high-level and low-level design (may not need both) will be defined, coupled with the project team. A detailed analysis with acceptance criteria [1] and mockups should be on the table at the end of this stage. | 
| 4 | Development | The name says it all. Developers code non-stop. | 
| 5 | Testing | Based on acceptance criteria and expected behaviors of specific scenarios, QAs test the system‚Äôs functionality in testing environments. Devs will be called many times if bugs are not entirely extinct. | 
| 6 | Deployment & Launch | Training before a roll-out is necessary if you don‚Äôt want your phone to become a hotline. Also applied for alignment before deployment. | 
| 7 | Measurement & Maintenance | Control laziness to measure the efficiency of the system/ feature based on success metrics and prevent it from a swarm of bugs. |

## Apply SDLC to relationship management?

Let‚Äôs imagine that you are a man who wants to follow a woman after seeing her Facebook. Given that she is still single to be easy (lucky you).

### Step 0: Stakeholder analysis

Just some examples of stakeholders are picked. Others, such as her children (hopefully not), are ignored.

| Priority | Stakeholders | Position | Interest | Influence | Action (RACI matrix) |
| --- | :----- | :------- | :----- | ----- | :----- |
| 1 | Her | Project sponsor + customer | Hopefully high | High | A |
| 2 | You | Project sponsor + team + customer | Extremely high | High | R,A |
| 3 | Her family members | Consultants | High | Medium | I |
| 4 | Her married friends | Subject matter experts | Medium | Medium | C |
| 5 | Your best friend | Project team (mainly beer partner) | Extremely low | Low | C |

Besides listing all possible stakeholders, don‚Äôt forget to get their interest and influence, by all means, to **prioritize** and have a clear **plan** to satisfy each of them.

For example, you can approach her friends who frequently like and comment on her posts, have pictures with children on their personal accounts, and ask for her favorite dishes and drinks. This will ‚Äúsatisfy‚Äù her friends now and her later.

### Step 1: Requirement elicitation & analysis

It‚Äôs time to chat with her and other stakeholders. Besides self-introduction and casual conversation, wisely ask for her current status and thoughts about relationship.

In this case, she has been alone for a while and wants to find someone to share. Hence, her **‚Äúbusiness‚Äù need** and **goal** are the same as yours, which is perfect.

After talking with her friends, you realize that she wants a partner, not a husband for now, meaning that the project scope is smaller; however, if you have skills and capacity, you can help her realize other needs, a life-long husband, and expand the scope. 

From the goal and scope of having a partner, **objectives** namely becoming her close friend in 2 months, her top-of-mind friend at lunch should be clearly defined. Some of which can be based on to form success metrics [2], i.e., how many days in a week she actively texts you to share something.

Also, don‚Äôt forget to note down the **estimated budget** and **release date** of this life-changing project.

### Step 2: Research/ Feasibility study

When flirting, try to **research** more information about her to make sure that you are somewhat ‚Äúqualified‚Äù in her eyes. Some types of feasibilities [3]:

- **Economic**, e.g., With your monthly salary, can you afford a Hermes clutch on her birthday as it‚Äôs her favorite branded item?
- **Legal**, e.g., Is she over 18? üôÖ
- **Technical**, e.g., Are you a lady killer?
- **Schedule**, e.g., Is it possible to get her official agreement after 6 months, regarding the current situation of both?

The more research you conduct, the more resources you can save later. Highly recommend using **Proof of Concept (PoC)** template for long-term usage.

> Proof of Concept is a model created to validate the design of a system without modelling the appearance, materials used in the creation of work, or processes/workflows ultimately used by the stakeholders *(BABOK v3, A GUIDE TO THE BUSINESS ANALYSIS BODY OF KNOWLEDGE)*

### Step 3: Design 

If you still believe that she is the one and you also fit her, congratulations! You‚Äôre so patient.

You can now formulate **high-level to low-level strategies** to approach her. Make sure to include **work breakdown structure** to avoid missing items as the following simple example:

![Work breakdown structure / WBS (Example)](/media/blog1-becomeherpartner.png)
*Work breakdown structure / WBS (Example)*


> WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables *(A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK¬Æ Guide) ‚Äì Fifth Edition PMI, 2013)*

Based on the diagram, you work closely with your beer partner to document **detailed plans** with acceptance criteria and different scenarios that may happen, e.g., Be prepared if you bump into your ex when hanging out with her. 

In IT projects, it‚Äôs necessary to **get sign-off** from all stakeholders before development but in ‚Äúromantic projects‚Äù, no one dares approve. Is that the reason why many experienced project managers/ product managers are still single?

### Step 4: Development

Just implement your plan with the project team. Hope that not all of the plans fail. But if so, please go back to step 1 and 2

### Step 5: Testing

At this stage, both of you are moving one step closer to the golden time. Now you can utilize the acceptance criteria to evaluate *how deep your love* is before proposals.

There are usually 2 possible scenarios:

1. All criteria are fulfilled. Woohoo! Passing them almost guarantees your proposal plan. But man, don‚Äôt count your chickens before they hatch. 
2. A few criteria are not passed. No worries, try to revise what has been done and rework until meeting them.

For instance, if her best friend shares that there has been a guy who looks like CR7 (not you) hanging out with her frequently in the past few weeks. It sounds an alarm bell about the failed objective ‚Äì Become her top-of-mind friend, where you should send more messages, call her more, ship more snacks, etc., to win her back. Don‚Äôt be scared due to his fame ‚Ä¶ although it really is.

### Step 6: Deployment & Launch

You two have made a lot of progress, and it‚Äôs time you propose, and she will say üÜó.

Hang on‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not that easy.

Sometimes she may nod her head when you are joking about the proposal (Testing environment), but when it truly happens (Production environment), she may say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôre so good, but abcxyz ‚Ä¶‚Äù

But if you **form an alignment** with her family members, her friends in advance (Align with stakeholders before deployment), your chance of success will be much higher.

### Step 7: Measurement & Maintenance

After she says yes, it‚Äôs not done. Life is not that easy, man!

As you may know, the first few months are the easiest time to break up because you two don‚Äôt have enough time to understand and sympathize with each other. Hence, ‚Äú**measuring**‚Äù the health of your relationship periodically based on the defined success metrics above is necessary.

I guess you don‚Äôt want her to say something like this after the first week.

Moreover, you may need to spend time taking care of her frequently (maintain the system), especially when you want to expand the scope.

## Final words

Don‚Äôt tell me that you believe in the fact that I‚Äôm a master of love ü§£. In fact, I‚Äôm still single. 
Simply wanna write down some lessons that I‚Äôve learned through some professional and ‚Äúspecial‚Äù projects. Looking forward to your thoughts and comments below.
