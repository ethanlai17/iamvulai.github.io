I will pursue Master degree in Information Systems at The University of Sheffield in September 2021.</li>\n<li>Work is my favorite topic including sharing work experience (especially moving from non-tech to tech), dealing with salary and benefits, learning from start-up, correcting sitting positions during work, etc.</li>\n<li>Besides work, I’m also keen on FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) with some sub-topics related to different types of investment, passive income streams, and many more.
